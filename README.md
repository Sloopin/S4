Semester 4 - Cybersecurity

Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing: Practicing the stages of the penetration testing methodology, including Intel Gathering, Footprinting, Vulnerability Analysis and Reporting. Used tools like web scrapers, Google Dorking, Maltego, Nmap, Metasploit, Aireplay, theHarvester, and many more. Conducted vulnerability assessments on a real company and did ethical hacking exercises on PicoCTF and HackTheBox. Social engineering like using phishing, EvilTwin (rogue access points) documented and practiced.

Host, Network Security and Monitoring: Configured and managed network security solutions such as pfSense firewall, Wazuh for Host-based Intrusion Detection (HIDS), and Suricata + Snort for Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention (NIDS). Aditionally wrote custom rules on top of integrating the top rulesets to reduce the attack surface. Utilized network scanning and analysis tools like Nmap for port scanning and service enumeration, and Wireshark for traffic analysis and protocol understanding.

Web Application Security: Gained hands-on experience with the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and Juice Shop to understand and mitigate web application vulnerabilities, focusing on techniques like SQL Injection, XSS, Path Traversal, File Inclusion, Command Injection, DDOS, and many more. Learned to protect web applications using ModSecurity Web Application Firewall (WAF) and OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS).

Secure Network Infrastructure: Implemented network segmentation and managed secure network environments, including DMZ setups and network routing with pfSense. Set up and managed OpenVPN connections, focusing on secure remote access and SSL/TLS user authentication. Deployed secure 2FA on various services like SSH and Admin Panels. Gained experience with VSphere Infrastructure deployment.

Wireless Security and Password Cracking: specialized in testing the security of WPA, WPA2, WPS, WEP and cracking obtained hashes. Written extensive documentation on the subject, researched and deployed mitigation tactics. ARP Spoofing, Man in the middle and packet sniffing with Wireshark have also been explored.

Incident Response and Analysis: conducted a security incident analysis exercise for a hypothetical company focusing on mitigation strategies and continuous security improvements. Assessed various CVEâ€™s using the CVSS Framework.
